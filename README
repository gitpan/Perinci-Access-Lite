NAME
    Perinci::Access::Lite - A lightweight Riap client library

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of Perinci::Access::Lite (from Perl
    distribution Perinci-Access-Lite), released on 2014-09-03.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a lightweight alternative to Perinci::Access. It has less
    prerequisites but does fewer things. Differences with Perinci::Access:

    *   No wrapping, no argument checking

        For 'pl' or schemeless URL, no wrapping (Perinci::Sub::Wrapper) is
        done, only normalization (using Perinci::Sub::Normalize).

    *   No transaction or logging support

    *   No support for some schemes

        This includes: Riap::Simple over pipe/TCP socket.

METHODS
  new => obj
  $pa->request($action, $url, $extra) => hash
